# SlopeSense

SlopeSense is a simple PyQt-based application that allows you to load and analyze elevation data from GPX files. It provides a graphical representation of the elevation profile and allows you to select and analyze specific points on the profile to help you plan ahead. The application can also automatically find and use significant extrema. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, and it is intended to be used as a tool to help you plan your route.
